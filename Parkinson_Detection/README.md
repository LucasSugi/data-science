# Parkinson Detection

Analysis and modeling to predict people with Parkinson's disease.

# Note

Because the dataset is too large, the Data folder does not contain all the information needed to run the notebook's.

If you want to execute them you will need to download the tappy-keystroke data (link below) and follow these steps:
1. Create a folder named tappy-keystroke inside the Data folder.
2. In tappy-keystroke extract the two zip's from link and put these names.
3. Archived-Data.zip: Tappy Data.
4. Archived-users.zip: Archived users.
  

Now it's possible to run the notebook's.
